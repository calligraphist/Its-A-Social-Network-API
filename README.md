## Description of Project
This text editoris an application where the user can create notes or code snippets and is developed by using starter code. It can function both online and offline. Needed to use a variety of data persistence options in order to ensure that data is not lost in any scenario. The application first looks to use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that it will use local storage. For use offline, this application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application.
